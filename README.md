# Classification and Visualization of Pose data from Blazepose

### About the dataset

The dataset is of human poses while excercising in the gym. The activities are named in the first column. The dataset is result of feeding excercise videos into Google's [Blazepose](https://ai.googleblog.com/2020/08/on-device-real-time-body-posetracking.html).

### Implementation

I will create a visualization (GIF) of the excercises and build a classifier to distinguish different movements or group similar excercises together.
